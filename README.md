## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

I began by reviewing the design specifications. Then, I created the markup, knowing the mobile and desktop layouts would be similar and managed mainly by CSS grid. After completing the markup, I started styling with a mobile-first approach and added media queries for transitioning between mobile and desktop layouts. Once 95% of the styling was done, I moved on to coding the JavaScript. The JavaScript logic, especially the theme switch, required several iterations of changes to the markup and CSS.

## Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

## What I learned

This project was a great exercise for improving my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox. It was also my first project on Code Alpha that involved JavaScript, so it helped me get comfortable with functional programming, event listeners, and local storage.

## Continued development

For future projects, I plan to focus on learning React to improve my front-end development skills. I'm also enjoying my progress with CSS Grid and Flexbox, so Iâ€™ll continue practicing these techniques.
